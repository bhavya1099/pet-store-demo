================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-89: SQL Injection
Issue: If any part of the application constructs SQL queries using string concatenation with unsanitized user input, it can be vulnerable to SQL injection attacks that can lead to data leakage, data loss, or unauthorized access.
Solution: Use prepared statements, parameterized queries, or ORM methods to safely construct SQL queries.

Vulnerability: CWE-79: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
Issue: If the application returns user input in HTTP responses without properly encoding or escaping it, it can be vulnerable to cross-site scripting attacks. This can lead to session hijacking, identity theft, defacement of website, and other attacks.
Solution: Use context-aware output encoding libraries to properly encode user input before returning it in HTTP responses.

Vulnerability: CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
Issue: If the application processes state-changing requests (e.g., changing a user's email, deleting a record) without verifying the source of the request, it can be vulnerable to CSRF attacks. This can lead to unauthorized changes made on behalf of the user.
Solution: Use anti-CSRF tokens in forms and verify them on the server side before processing state-changing requests.

Vulnerability: CWE-22: Path Traversal
Issue: If the application uses unsanitized user input to construct file paths, it can be vulnerable to path traversal attacks. This can lead to unauthorized file access.
Solution: Use secure methods to access files, sanitize user input used in file paths, and limit application's file access permissions.

================================================================================
1. Scenario: Validate that the Pet object is successfully created when a non-null and non-empty string is passed as a parameter.
   - Given a non-null and non-empty string as parameter
   - When the Pet object is created 
   - Then the Pet object should be successfully created with the given name

2. Scenario: Validate that the Pet object is not created when a null string is passed as a parameter.
   - Given a null string as parameter
   - When the Pet object is created 
   - Then it should throw a NullPointerException

3. Scenario: Validate that the Pet object is not created when an empty string is passed as a parameter.
   - Given an empty string as parameter
   - When the Pet object is created 
   - Then it should not be successfully created, and it may throw an IllegalArgumentException or a similar exception

4. Scenario: Validate that the Pet object is successfully created when a string with whitespace is passed as a parameter.
   - Given a string with whitespace as parameter
   - When the Pet object is created 
   - Then the Pet object should be successfully created with the given name

5. Scenario: Validate that the Pet object is successfully created when a string with special characters is passed as a parameter.
   - Given a string with special characters as parameter
   - When the Pet object is created 
   - Then the Pet object should be successfully created with the given name

6. Scenario: Validate that the Pet object is successfully created when a string with numbers is passed as a parameter.
   - Given a string with numbers as parameter
   - When the Pet object is created 
   - Then the Pet object should be successfully created with the given name

7. Scenario: Validate that the Pet object is successfully created when a string with a combination of numbers, special characters, and alphabets is passed as a parameter.
   - Given a string with a combination of numbers, special characters, and alphabets as parameter
   - When the Pet object is created 
   - Then the Pet object should be successfully created with the given name
