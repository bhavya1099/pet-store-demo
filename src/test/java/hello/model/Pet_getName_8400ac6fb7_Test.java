================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Information Exposure (CWE-200)
Issue: The 'name' field is exposed publicly without any control, potential sensitive information could be retrieved by unauthorized users.
Solution: Consider encapsulating the field within the class and providing controlled access to it through getter and setter methods. Apply principle of least privilege.

Vulnerability: Missing Access Control (CWE-285)
Issue: Public methods that modify or access sensitive data can be accessed by any class or method, leading to potential unauthorized access or modification.
Solution: Consider using the 'private' or 'protected' access modifiers to limit the visibility of your methods and fields. Use getter and setter methods to control access.

Vulnerability: Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)
Issue: Without proper access controls, an attacker can manipulate direct object references to gain unauthorized access to data.
Solution: Always check that the user is authorized to access the requested resource. This can be done in the service layer of your application.

================================================================================
1. Scenario: Check if the getName() function returns the correct name
   Test Steps:
   - Set a name in the object
   - Call the getName() function
   - Assert that the returned name is the same as the one set

2. Scenario: Check if the getName() function returns null when no name is set
   Test Steps:
   - Do not set a name in the object
   - Call the getName() function
   - Assert that the returned name is null

3. Scenario: Check if the getName() function returns an empty string when the name is set to an empty string
   Test Steps:
   - Set the name in the object to an empty string
   - Call the getName() function
   - Assert that the returned name is an empty string

4. Scenario: Check if the getName() function returns the correct name when the name is set multiple times
   Test Steps:
   - Set the name in the object to a string
   - Set the name in the object to a different string
   - Call the getName() function
   - Assert that the returned name is the same as the last one set

5. Scenario: Check if the getName() function returns the correct name when the name contains special characters
   Test Steps:
   - Set the name in the object to a string containing special characters
   - Call the getName() function
   - Assert that the returned name is the same as the one set

6. Scenario: Check if the getName() function returns the correct name when the name contains spaces
   Test Steps:
   - Set the name in the object to a string containing spaces
   - Call the getName() function
   - Assert that the returned name is the same as the one set

7. Scenario: Check if the getName() function returns the correct name when the name is a very long string
   Test Steps:
   - Set the name in the object to a very long string
   - Call the getName() function
   - Assert that the returned name is the same as the one set

Please note that the @NotNull annotation is not applicable to the getName() method as it is a getter method and not a setter. The @NotNull annotation is generally used to validate that the field is not null during a persistence operation.
